# walk-with-me

## HEADLINE
"Walk With Me" is a simple online application that allows users to sign up to walk dogs at RescuePup, our fictional dog shelter.

## ABOUT THIS PROJECT
Given the paramaters we received for the creation of our CRUD/database application, we tried to conceive of a real-world problem that could be solved using the technologies and skills that we have learned.  Unloved dogs without responsible owners and homes are an ongoing concern in the United States with roughly 3.3 million dogs entering shelter care every year. Just like any animal, these dogs need exercise and this is a tough job to be handled exclusively by shelter employees.  "walk-with-me" uses express, passport, ejs and MongoDB to provide a web-based application that the general public can use to volunteer and walk shelter dogs at a specific calendered time, thereby increasing the health and wellbeing of shelter dogs and reducing strain on shelter finances and administration.  

This project presented some  unique challenges for us, particularly as it required each of us to work with another developer on a project for the first time.  Github and Heroku required a great deal of learning on our part.  We have included our wireframes, user stories and database model below so that users may more deeply inform themselves of our project.
